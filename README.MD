the images. There are 12 images(6 png and 6 jpg). The second button is used to clear all the
image. The third button is determine whether the filter is used or not. ‘On’ means filter is
 used, ‘off’ otherwise. When the filter is used, the value of rating bars determine which image

 filter will show images with 3, 4, or 5 stars). Otherwise, all the loaded image will be displayed.
 When first launched, the application shows an empty window. Selecting on each image will get
an enlarged image. It will disappear if you touch any part of screen except the image. Each 
image can be rating by the rating bar under the image. The reset button will set the rating
